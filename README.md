# Wearable Electronic Glove and Multi-layer Parallel LSTM-CNN based Method for Sign Language Recognition.
In this git repository a Para-LSTM-CNN algorithm based on parallel features extraction strategy is proposed. The temporal and spatial features of the sensor signals are extracted through long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), respectively. The Para-LSTM-CNN can effectively improve the accuracy of sign language recognition by fusing spatial and temporal features synchronously.
